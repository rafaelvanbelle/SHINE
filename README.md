# SHINE âœ¨

Code repository for the paper: SHINE: A Scalable Heterogeneous Inductive Graph
Neural Network for Large Imbalanced Datasets


## Requirements:

**Note**: SHINE requires Pytorch Geometric v2.1.0. Other versions are currently not supported. 
To install Pytorch Geometric, please refer to the official docs of v2.1.0: [https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.0/notes/installation.html](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.0/notes/installation.html)

The code has been tested under Python 3.6,3.7 and 3.8. The required packages can be installed using the following
command:

``$ pip install -r requirements.txt``

To guarantee that you have the right package versions, you can use Anaconda to set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies from ``requirements.txt``.


## Running the code

### Step 1:

The demo code is available as a Jupyter Notebook.
